    THE DESIGN CONSIDERATION
A design consideration plays a pivotal role in shaping the user experience and overall usability of the application. User interface (UI) designing an intuitive and visually appealing interface that enhances user interaction.
    THE UTULIZATION OF GITHUB AND GITHUB ACTION
GitHub serves as a central repository for the application's source code, facilitating collaborative development and version control.
GitHub is a web site enables developers to host all their applications codebase and it is allowing us to collaborate, share code, and track changes codebase. GITHUB enables developers to track changes to the codebase, manage different versions, and collaborate seamlessly with team members through features. GITHUB facilitates collaboration among developers by providing tools for issue tracking, project boards, and teams management, allowing communication and coordination.
Definition: GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. Workflow automate: GitHub Actions allows developers to automate various tasks, such as code formatting, testing, and deployment, through custom workflows defined in YAML configuration files. GitHub Actions enable developers to build their applications with ease.
According to this assignment, we use GitHub to push our project or application and we use GitHub Action to run test and build our application to make sure it will work not just on our computer.
